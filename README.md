This Blazor application allows users to manage servers located in different cities. The application provides features to view, add, edit, and delete servers, as well as to monitor their online/offline status.

### City Selection and Server List
* The interface shows different cities: Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Calgary, and Halifax.
